# ✅ Switched from LTL API to Express API

## 🎯 What Changed

**Before**: Using **LTL API** (for freight/warehouse shipping)
- Endpoint: `/pickup_requests`
- Required: Different token format (`Bearer`)
- Error: "Token Decode Error"

**After**: Using **Express API** (for standard parcels) ✅
- Endpoint: `/fm/request/new/`
- Uses: Your existing token (`Token`)
- Works: With your current setup!

---

## 🤔 Why This Fix Works

### **LTL API vs Express API**

**LTL (Less Than Truckload) API:**
- For large shipments, freight, pallets
- Complex warehouse-to-warehouse logistics
- Requires special token format
- ❌ Not needed for e-commerce art prints!

**Express API:**
- For standard parcel delivery
- E-commerce packages, small shipments
- Uses standard Delhivery token
- ✅ Perfect for your use case!

## 💡 Key Differences

### Express API (What You Now Use)
```javascript
{
  warehouse_name: "Lurevi - Janak puri",
  pickup_date: "2025-10-19",
  pickup_time: "10:00:00",
  quantity: 1
}
```

### LTL API (What You Were Using - Wrong!)
```javascript
{
  client_warehouse: "Lurevi - Janak puri",
  pickup_date: "2025-10-19",
  start_time: "10:00:00",
  expected_package_count: 1
}
```

Different field names, different API!

## ✅ Benefits of Express API

3. **Compatible**: Works with your current setup
4. **No Changes Needed**: Same token, just different endpoint!

---

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

After switching to Express API, if you still get an error:

1. **Check token is set correctly**:
   ```powershell
   npx supabase@latest secrets list
   ```
   Look for `DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN`

2. **Verify warehouse name exists in Delhivery dashboard**

3. **Contact Delhivery** if warehouse exists but API fails:
   Email: api-support@delhivery.com
