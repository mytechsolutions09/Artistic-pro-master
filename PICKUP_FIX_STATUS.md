## 3. Next Steps to Test

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Check API Token Secret

```powershell
npx supabase@latest secrets set DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN=your_actual_delhivery_token_here
```

**Option 2: Check in Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/varduayfdqivaofymfov/settings/functions
2. Click on "Secrets"
3. Verify `DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN` exists
4. If not, add it with your Delhivery API token

### 🧪 Test Pickup Creation

1. **Open Browser Developer Tools (F12)**
   - Go to the "Console" tab
   - Keep it open during testing

2. **Navigate to Admin Panel**
   - URL: Your admin URL
   - Go to: Shipping → Pickup tab

3. **Create a Pickup**
   - Select a warehouse from dropdown
   - Select shipments to pickup
   - Set pickup date and time
   - Click "Request Pickup"

4. **Check Console Logs**
   You should see:
   ```
   🚀 handleRequestPickup called
   📦 Pickup request data: {...}
   📤 Sending pickup request to Delhivery...
   🚀 Starting pickup request with: {...}
   📦 Requesting pickup from Delhivery LTL API with payload: {...}
   ```

   **Success:**
   ```
   ✅ Pickup requested successfully via Delhivery API
   🆔 Pickup ID: XXXXX
   ```

   **Failure (with detailed error):**
   ```
   ❌ Warehouse not found in Delhivery
   📋 Error details: The warehouse name does not exist in Delhivery system...
   💡 Troubleshooting steps: [...]
   ```

## 4. Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Warehouse not found in Delhivery"
**Cause**: Warehouse name in database doesn't match Delhivery registration

**Solution**:
1. Check your warehouse name in: Admin Panel → Shipping → Warehouse
2. Log into Delhivery dashboard
3. Verify exact name match (case-sensitive!)
4. If different, either:
   - Update in your database to match Delhivery
   - Register the warehouse in Delhivery with the database name

### Issue 2: "401 Unauthorized" or "Authentication failed"
**Cause**: DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN secret not set or invalid

**Solution**:
```powershell
npx supabase@latest secrets set DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN=your_valid_token_here
```

### Issue 3: "Edge Function error"
**Cause**: Function deployment issue

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Redeploy
npx supabase@latest functions deploy delhivery-api --no-verify-jwt

# Verify
npx supabase@latest functions list
```
