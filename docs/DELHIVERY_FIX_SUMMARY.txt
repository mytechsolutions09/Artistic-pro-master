DELHIVERY INTEGRATION FIX - QUICK SUMMARY
====================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Changes made in admin panel (warehouse edits, shipment updates) were NOT 
syncing to Delhivery platform. Only local database was being updated.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors - Direct browser calls to 
Delhivery API were blocked by browser security.

SOLUTION:
---------
Route all write operations through Supabase Edge Function proxy to avoid CORS.

FILES CHANGED:
--------------
1. ✅ src/services/DelhiveryService.ts
   - Updated createWarehouse() to use makeApiCall()
   - Updated editWarehouse() to use makeApiCall()
   - Updated editShipment() to use makeApiCall()
   - Updated cancelShipmentViaEdit() to use makeApiCall()

2. ✅ supabase/functions/delhivery-api/index.ts
   - Added support for 'main' endpoint

3. ✅ deploy-delhivery-edge-function.ps1 (NEW)
   - Windows deployment script

4. ✅ deploy-delhivery-edge-function.sh (NEW)
   - Linux/Mac deployment script

5. ✅ DELHIVERY_INTEGRATION_FIX.md (NEW)
   - Complete documentation with testing instructions

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
-----------------
1. Deploy Edge Function:
   PowerShell: .\deploy-delhivery-edge-function.ps1
   OR
   Bash: ./deploy-delhivery-edge-function.sh
   OR
   Manual: supabase functions deploy delhivery-api --no-verify-jwt

2. Set Delhivery API Token (if not already set):
   supabase secrets set DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN=your_token_here

3. Rebuild & deploy your frontend app:
   npm run build
   (then deploy to your hosting platform)

TESTING:
--------
1. Edit a warehouse in admin panel
2. Check browser console for: 
   "✅ Warehouse updated in Delhivery and database!"
3. Verify the change appears in Delhivery dashboard

WHAT'S FIXED:
-------------
✅ Warehouse creation → Now syncs to Delhivery
✅ Warehouse editing → Now syncs to Delhivery  
✅ Shipment editing → Now syncs to Delhivery
✅ Shipment cancellation → Now syncs to Delhivery
