# ✅ Meta Catalog Match Rate Fix - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Your Meta Commerce Manager showed:
- **Catalog Match Rate: 0%** ❌
- **3 Events Unavailable:**
  - Product View (ViewContent)
  - Adding to cart (AddToCart)
  - Purchase

**Root Cause:** Meta Pixel events were not being tracked when users interact with products.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. ViewContent Event (Product View)**
**File:** `src/pages/ClothingProductPage.tsx`

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (product) {
    // Track ViewContent event for Meta Pixel
    MetaPixelService.trackViewContent({
      content_ids: [product.id],
      content_name: product.title,
      content_type: 'product',
      value: product.price,
      currency: 'INR'
    });
  }
}, [product]);
```

**Fires When:** User views any product page  
**Sends:** Product ID, title, price in INR

---

### **2. AddToCart Event (Adding to Cart)**
**File:** `src/pages/ClothingProductPage.tsx`

```typescript
// Track AddToCart event for Meta Pixel
MetaPixelService.trackAddToCart({
  content_ids: [product.id],
  content_name: product.title,
  content_type: 'product',
  value: product.price,
  currency: 'INR'
});
```

**Fires When:** User clicks "Add to Cart" button  
**Sends:** Product ID, title, price in INR

---

### **3. Purchase Event (Completed Purchase)**
**File:** `src/pages/PaymentSuccess.tsx`

```typescript
// Track Purchase event for Meta Pixel
MetaPixelService.trackPurchase({
  content_ids: transformedOrder.items.map(item => item.id),
  content_type: 'product',
  value: transformedOrder.total,
  currency: 'INR',
  num_items: transformedOrder.items.length
});
```

**Fires When:** User reaches payment success page  
**Sends:** All product IDs, total order value, number of items

---

## 🔍 Product ID Matching (Critical!)

### **The Key to Catalog Match Rate**

For Meta to match pixel events to catalog products, **the IDs must be identical**:

**CSV Export (product_catalog.csv):**
```csv
product_id,title,price,...
8b095204-48ce-4360-8f40-6f40d7bfa66f,Hoodie,2449,...
```

**Pixel Event:**
```javascript
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_ids: ['8b095204-48ce-4360-8f40-6f40d7bfa66f'],
  ...
});
```

✅ **Both use `product.id` (UUID)** - They match!

---

## 📋 Testing & Verification

### **Step 1: Test Events in Browser Console**

1. **Open Developer Console** (F12)
2. **Go to Network Tab** → Filter by "tr?" or "facebook"
3. **Visit a product page**
   - You should see: `ViewContent` event
   - Check the `cd[content_ids]` parameter contains product UUID
   
4. **Add product to cart**
   - You should see: `AddToCart` event
   - Verify product ID is correct
   
5. **Complete a test purchase**
   - You should see: `Purchase` event on success page
   - Verify all purchased product IDs are included

### **Step 2: Use Meta Pixel Helper (Chrome Extension)**

1. Install **Meta Pixel Helper** from Chrome Web Store
2. Visit your website
3. Click the extension icon
4. You should see:
   - ✅ Pixel Loaded
   - ✅ PageView event
   - ✅ ViewContent event (on product pages)
   - ✅ AddToCart event (when adding to cart)
   - ✅ Purchase event (on success page)

### **Step 3: Check Meta Events Manager**

1. Go to **Meta Business Suite**
2. Navigate to **Events Manager**
3. Select your Pixel (ID: `1905415970060955`)
4. Go to **Test Events** tab
5. Perform actions on your website
6. Events should appear in real-time!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Events Not Showing in Console**

**Check:**
1. Meta Pixel is installed in `index.html` ✅
2. Pixel ID is correct: `1905415970060955` ✅
3. No ad blockers interfering
4. Browser console shows no errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if fbq is defined
console.log(typeof fbq); // Should be "function"
```

### **Product IDs Don't Match**

**Check CSV Export:**
```bash
# First line of CSV should be:
product_id,title,description,price,...

# Product IDs should be UUIDs like:
8b095204-48ce-4360-8f40-6f40d7bfa66f
```

**Check Pixel Events:**
```javascript
// In console, check event data:
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_ids: ['8b095204-48ce-4360-8f40-6f40d7bfa66f'], // UUID
  ...
});
```

### **Catalog Match Rate Still 0% After 48 Hours**

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Different Product IDs** in CSV vs events
2. **Currency mismatch** (catalog vs events)
3. **Catalog not approved** by Meta yet
4. **Domain not verified**

**Solution:**
1. Re-export catalog with latest code
2. Delete old catalog from Meta
3. Upload new catalog
4. Perform test transactions
5. Wait 24-48 hours
