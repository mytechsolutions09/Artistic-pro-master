-- =====================================================
-- COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY FIX FOR SUPABASE DATABASE
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes all critical security issues identified by Supabase linter
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- =====================================================
-- 1. FIX EXPOSED AUTH.USERS IN CONFIRMED_USERS VIEW
-- =====================================================
-- The confirmed_users view should not expose auth.users to anon role
-- We'll either remove it or restrict access to authenticated users only

-- Drop existing grants to anon
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    -- Revoke access from anon role
    EXECUTE 'REVOKE ALL ON confirmed_users FROM anon';
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Revoked anon access from confirmed_users view';
END $$;

-- Recreate the view without SECURITY DEFINER, or with proper security
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS confirmed_users CASCADE;

CREATE VIEW confirmed_users 
WITH (security_invoker = true)  -- Use security_invoker instead of security_definer
AS
SELECT 
  id,
  email,
  created_at,
  email_confirmed_at,
  last_sign_in_at
FROM auth.users
WHERE email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Grant access only to authenticated users, NOT to anon
GRANT SELECT ON confirmed_users TO authenticated;

COMMENT ON VIEW confirmed_users IS 'View of users who have confirmed their email addresses (authenticated users only)';

-- =====================================================
-- 2. ENABLE RLS ON ORDERS AND ORDER_ITEMS TABLES
-- =====================================================
-- These tables have policies but RLS is not enabled

-- Enable RLS on orders table
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Enable RLS on order_items table  
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS order_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS enabled successfully on orders and order_items tables

-- =====================================================
-- 3. FIX SECURITY DEFINER VIEWS
