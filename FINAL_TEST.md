## 🎯 Most Likely Issues with Express API

### **Issue #1: Warehouse Name Not Registered (80%)**

**Symptom**: HTTP 400 or 404 error

**Cause**: "Lurevi - Janak puri" is not registered in Delhivery's Express API system

**Why**: 
- You see it in your Delhivery dashboard
- But it might only be registered for viewing, not for API access
- Or it's registered under a different name

**Solution**:
1. Log into Delhivery dashboard
2. Go to: Settings → Pickup Locations or Warehouse Management
3. Check if "Lurevi - Janak puri" shows in API-accessible warehouses
4. If not, register it for API access
5. Or use a different warehouse name that IS registered

### **Issue #2: Token Doesn't Have Pickup Permission (15%)**

**Symptom**: HTTP 403 Forbidden

**Cause**: Your API token doesn't have "Create Pickup" permission

**Solution**: Contact Delhivery Support
- Email: api-support@delhivery.com
- Request: Enable pickup creation permission for your token

### **Issue #3: Wrong Environment (5%)**

**Symptom**: HTTP 404 or authentication errors

**Cause**: Using staging environment but need production (or vice versa)

**Current**: `staging-express.delhivery.com`
**Alternative**: `express-dev-test.delhivery.com` or production URL

**Solution**: Ask Delhivery which environment to use

## 📧 Contact Delhivery Support (Likely Needed)

Since the warehouse shows in your dashboard but API fails, you probably need Delhivery to:

**Email**: api-support@delhivery.com

**Subject**: Enable API Pickup Access for Warehouse

**Message**:
```
Hi Delhivery Team,

I'm trying to create pickup requests via API but getting errors.

Warehouse Details:
- Name: Lurevi - Janak puri
- Location: Delhi
- Status: Active in my dashboard

API Details:
- Endpoint: POST /fm/request/new/
- Environment: staging-express.delhivery.com
- Error: [Share error from test]

The warehouse is visible and active in my dashboard, but when I try
to create a pickup via API, it fails.

Could you please:
1. Verify "Lurevi - Janak puri" is enabled for API pickup requests
2. Confirm my API token has pickup creation permission
3. Let me know the correct warehouse name for API (if different)
4. Confirm I'm using the correct environment (staging vs production)

Account Email: [your email]
Company: Lurevi

Thank you!
```
