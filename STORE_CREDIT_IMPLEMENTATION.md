- **Security**: Row-level security policies to protect user data
- **Functions**: Secure database functions for all credit operations

### 2. Service Layer

- **Transaction History**: View all past transactions
- **Payment Processing**: Handle full or partial store credit payments

### 3. User Interface

### 4. Payment Flow

#### Full Store Credit Payment
1. User checks "Use Store Credit"
2. If balance â‰¥ order total:
   - Payment method auto-switches to 'store_credit'
   - Order completes immediately without Razorpay
   - Credit is deducted from user account
   - Order marked as paid with store credit

#### Partial Store Credit Payment
1. User checks "Use Store Credit"
2. If balance < order total:
   - Maximum available credit is applied
   - Remaining amount shown
   - User proceeds with Razorpay for remaining amount
   - Both payments processed (credit + Razorpay)
   - Order notes reflect both payment methods

## Database Setup

### To Deploy the Database Schema:

1. **Option 1: Supabase Dashboard**
   ```
   1. Open Supabase Dashboard
   2. Go to SQL Editor
   3. Copy contents of database/create_store_credit_system.sql
   4. Run the SQL
   ```

2. **Option 2: Supabase CLI**
   ```bash
   supabase db execute --file database/create_store_credit_system.sql
   ```

3. **Option 3: PowerShell Script**
   ```powershell
   # Create a deployment script
   $sql = Get-Content "database/create_store_credit_system.sql" -Raw
   # Deploy using your preferred method
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Adding Store Credit (120-Day Return)
```typescript
import StoreCreditService from '../services/storeCreditService';

// When processing a 120-day return with 50% refund
const result = await StoreCreditService.addCredit(
  userId,
  refundAmount, // 50% of purchase price
  `120-day return refund for order #${orderId}`,
  orderId,
  'return'
);

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Credit added. New balance:', result.balance);
}
```

### Checking Balance
```typescript
const balance = await StoreCreditService.getUserBalance(userId);
console.log('Available credit:', balance);
```

### Using Store Credit for Payment
The system automatically handles this in the checkout flow:
- User checks "Use Store Credit" checkbox
- System calculates available credit to use
- Processes payment with credit
- Handles remaining amount if any

## Admin Features (To Be Implemented)

### Suggested Admin Panel Features:
1. **View All Credits**: See store credit balances for all users
2. **Manual Credit Adjustment**: Add/remove credit manually
3. **Transaction Reports**: View all credit transactions
4. **Refund Processing**: Process returns and issue credits
5. **Credit Analytics**: Track credit usage and trends

## Integration Points

### 120-Day Return Policy
When a customer requests a 120-day return:
1. Admin processes the return
2. Calculates 50% refund amount
3. Calls `StoreCreditService.addCredit()` with 'return' type
4. Customer receives email notification about credit
5. Credit appears in their account immediately

### Checkout Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing Razorpay payment
- Works with COD orders (credit applied, COD for remaining)
- Full audit trail of all payments

## Security Features

1. **RLS Policies**: Users can only see their own credits
2. **Server-Side Functions**: All credit operations use secure database functions
3. **Transaction Logging**: Complete audit trail
4. **Balance Validation**: Prevents negative balances
5. **Atomic Operations**: Credit deductions are transactional

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Test adding store credit manually
- [ ] Test checkout with full store credit
- [ ] Test checkout with partial store credit
- [ ] Test checkout with no store credit
- [ ] Verify credit deduction on successful payment
- [ ] Verify credit not deducted on failed payment
- [ ] Check transaction history
- [ ] Test with multiple users
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Database Schema**: Run the SQL migration
2. **Test Store Credit**: Add some test credit to a user account
3. **Test Checkout Flow**: Complete a test purchase with store credit
4. **Admin Panel**: Add admin interface for managing credits
5. **Email Notifications**: Send emails when credit is added
6. **Dashboard Widget**: Show credit balance on user dashboard
