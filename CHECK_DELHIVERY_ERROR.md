## 🔍 Method 2: Check Supabase Dashboard Logs

   ```

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues

Based on your configuration:
- ✅ Edge Function is deployed
- ✅ API token is set
- ✅ Warehouse shows in your Delhivery dashboard: **"Lurevi - Janak puri"**
- ✅ Time format is now correct: **HH:MM:SS**

### Remaining Possibilities:

### 1. **Warehouse Not Activated for API (70% probability)**
Even though the warehouse exists in Delhivery dashboard, it might not be:
- Enabled for API access
- Activated in the API system
- Registered in the correct environment (dev vs production)

**Solution**: Contact Delhivery Support

### 2. **Wrong API Environment (20% probability)**
Your are using: **Development API** (`ltl-clients-api-dev.delhivery.com`)
You might need: **Production API** (`ltl-clients-api.delhivery.com`)

**Solution**: Ask Delhivery which environment to use

### 3. **Token Permissions (10% probability)**
Your API token might not have "Create Pickup" permission.

**Solution**: Ask Delhivery to enable pickup creation permission

Hi Delhivery Support,

I'm trying to create pickup requests via your LTL API but getting errors.

Warehouse Details:
- Name: Lurevi - Janak puri
- Location: Delhi
- Status: Active in dashboard

API Details:
- Endpoint: https://ltl-clients-api-dev.delhivery.com/pickup_requests
- Method: POST
- Error: 400 Bad Request (or whatever error you see)

The warehouse is visible in my dashboard and is Active, but the API 
returns an error when trying to create pickups.

Could you please:
1. Verify the warehouse "Lurevi - Janak puri" is enabled for API access
2. Confirm my API token has pickup creation permission
3. Let me know if I should use dev or production environment

Account Email: [your email]
Company: Lurevi

Thank you!
