## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to load shipments from database"

**Causes:**
1. Database tables not created
2. RLS policies blocking access
3. Supabase connection issue

**Solutions:**
1. Run `shipping_database_setup.sql` in Supabase
2. Check RLS policies for `shipments` table
3. Verify Supabase connection in console

### Issue: "Failed to save warehouse to database"

**Causes:**
1. Missing required fields
2. RLS policies
3. Unique constraint violations

**Solutions:**
1. Fill all required fields (name, phone, email, city, pin, address)
2. Check console for specific error
3. Verify warehouse doesn't already exist with same name

### Issue: "Shipments don't persist after refresh"

**Cause:** Data not being saved to database

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for errors during shipment creation
2. Verify `shippingService.createShipment()` is being called
3. Check Supabase logs for failed inserts

### Issue: "Import Orders shows no orders"

**Causes:**
1. No orders with "processing" status
2. Order service not loading correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Create test orders with status "processing"
2. Check `orders` table in Supabase
3. Verify `orderService.getAllOrders()` is working
