I need help enabling pickup permissions for my API token.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- My API token works perfectly for:
  ✅ Creating shipments (/api/cmu/create.json)

  ✅ Tracking shipments (/api/packages/json/)

- But returns 401 Unauthorized for:
  ❌ Pickup requests (/fm/request/new/)

WAREHOUSE DETAILS:
- Warehouse Name: "Lurevi - Janak puri"

- Warehouse name matches exactly (case-sensitive) with my system

Please enable pickup/CMU permissions for my API token so I can schedule pickup requests.
