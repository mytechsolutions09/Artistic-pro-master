# Option 2: Via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
# 2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
# 3. Copy contents from shipping_database_setup.sql
# 4. Paste and click "Run"
```

**Tables that will be created:**
- `shipments` - Main shipment records
- `warehouses` - Warehouse/pickup locations
- `pin_code_checks` - Pin code serviceability cache
- `shipping_rates` - Rate calculation cache
- `pickup_requests` - Pickup scheduling
- `expected_tat` - Delivery time estimates cache
- `waybill_generation_log` - Waybill tracking
- `shipment_tracking_events` - Shipment event history

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# ===========================================
# DELHIVERY API CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================

# Get your API token from: https://www.delhivery.com/
VITE_DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN=your-actual-delhivery-api-token-here

# For TESTING - Use staging URLs (already in template)
VITE_DELHIVERY_BASE_URL=https://staging-express.delhivery.com
VITE_DELHIVERY_EXPRESS_URL=https://express-dev-test.delhivery.com
VITE_DELHIVERY_TRACK_URL=https://track.delhivery.com

# API Settings
VITE_DELHIVERY_TIMEOUT=10000
VITE_DELHIVERY_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
```

### Step 3: Verify Access

1. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log in as admin** and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/admin/shipping`

## üß™ Testing Without Delhivery Account

**Good News:** The system works with mock data if you don't have Delhivery API credentials yet!

If `VITE_DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN` is not configured or set to placeholder values, the system will:
- ‚úÖ Show a warning notification
- ‚úÖ Use mock/sample data for testing
- ‚úÖ Let you test the entire UI and workflow
- ‚úÖ Store data in your database (shipments, warehouses, etc.)

**To test without API:**
1. Leave `VITE_DELHIVERY_API_TOKEN` as is (or set to `test-token`)
2. Access `/admin/shipping`
3. System will show: "Delhivery API not configured. Using mock data for testing."
4. You can still:
   - View sample shipments
   - Create mock shipments
   - Test the UI and workflows
   - Check pin codes (will return mock data)
